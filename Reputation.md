# StorX - Node Reputation:  AI-based Algorithm Explained

If you are keen on putting your unused disk space to work, contributing to building the future of cloud storage, and getting paid as well, StorX node ownership provides you an opportunity.
A decentralized cloud storage solution powered by XinFin (XDC) blockchain network, StorX facilitates secure encryption, fragmentation, and then distribution of data across multiple nodes hosted globally. This allows anyone to set up a node in the network and earn native SRX token.
The network combines enterprise-grade storage solutions such as Google Drive with reliable open source technology. Moreover, it arranges for the promotion of highly performing nodes and eliminates those that have been below the mark. It relies on an AI-based algorithm to determine node reputation.  


## Role of node operators / Farm Node Holder
StorX Network invites storage node operators to create storage supplies for the network. Inclusion of the nodes in the operation of the network and their reputation depends on node reputation. Click the link to get more detail on [How to Setup Farm node](https://storx.tech/host-node.html).


## What is node reputation
StorX is backed by a scalable and resilient mechanism to determine node reputation. Sophisticated StorX AI algorithm measures reliability and performance of the node, providing for its quantitative representation. The system uses reputation metrics to ensure that bad actors within the network are eliminated as participants, improving security, reliability, and durability of the network. 


## Inclusion of a new node in the network and reputation
The network has set up a neat process for the inclusion of a new node. When a storage node joins the network, its reliability is unknown, so the system sets its reputation to 0. Whenever someone uploads a new file to the StoX network, a set of unvetted nodes is included in the target list by the Satellite, while ensuring durability of the file remains unaffected. Satellite is an array of machine learning algorithms that lays out and optimizes payload distribution on the node.
 
To qualify for the storage of data, unvetted nodes need to show proof-of-work. Post vetting, the node is included in the standard selection process for general upload. When a node regularly stores data and rolls out proof-of-work for it, its reputation grows over time. 


## Reputation & Node Selection
For determining the list of standard storage nodes, a preference is established based on factors such as throughput and latency, history of reliability and uptime, geographic location, and more. The nodes conjoin into a load-balancing selection process, such that all uploads are sent to qualified nodes, with a higher likelihood of uploads to preferred nodes, but with a non-zero chance for any qualified node. The system keeps a check on the behavior of the node. Over a period of time, if it is able to provide data for downloads, pass audits and uptime checks, its reputation score increases.


## Reputation, Rewards and Penalties
Node reputation is a factor when determining the eligibility of a node’s XDC wallet for rewards. The StorX Governance team maintains a minimum threshold of reputation. The mark refers to the reputation of the node over which it is considered to be an active participant of the network, contributing enough to be eligible for the $SRX rewards. Currently this threshold is set to 10 units but the StorX Governance team could change to adapt to the expanding network.
For low-reputation nodes, there is provision of the penalties in the form of $SRX tokens. The AI engine deducts the penalty automatically from the staking / reward token wallet. To maintain transparency with the community, the entire process is stored inside the smart contract.  
 

## Reasons for low reputation
**If you are wondering about the reasons for low reputation for a node, these include**
* Incorrect setup of the node like node not reachable on the port mentioned in the config.
* High node response time
* Low traffic on the main application
 
**If you have set up the node properly, it gets selected for storage and the jump in its reputation is just a matter of time.**
 

## How to maintain a good node reputation?
A node which meets all the requirements mentioned in the [readme](https://github.com/StorXNetwork/StorX-Node#initial-set-up) will be considered a robust node. Its reputation will steadily increase with continual participation in the network. As the primary factor for increase in reputation of a node is its contribution to the network, more node activity on the network will result in better reputation for the node. For boosting reputation, therefore, node owners aka farmers are advised to share and use the StorX App as much as possible. 
To check reputation, users can go to their farmer [dashboard](https://farmer.storx.io/). Our team is working on a dedicated dashboard that will demonstrate the node’s statistics in more detail. 


## Feedback and suggestions
Your feedback and suggestions to beef up the Reputation based algorithm of rewards and penalty for the farm node are welcome. We look ahead to create an even better and more streamlined node reputation ecosystem and your suggestions will help us attain this objective.
